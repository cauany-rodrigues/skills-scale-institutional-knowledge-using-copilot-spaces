# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose

- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (include all relevant personas)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) with input from QA Automation Engineer
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (coordinate with DevOps Engineer)
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Plan UX research and design sprints if UX/UI Designer is involved
8. Identify documentation needs and timelines with Technical Writer
9. Schedule SME review sessions for domain-specific validation
